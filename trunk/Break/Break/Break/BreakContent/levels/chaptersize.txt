We'd been working for years.%%Our research was finally done. %% %%God... I never thought I'd actually be standing in front of it.

It was a time machine, of course. Time travel never works right in the movies. %%Why'd we think we could do better? %% %%Don't bother asking me how it worked.%%I can't explain now, and I don't care to. %%

My colleagues were gone, the familiar hum of machinery was gone, and before my eyes, %%the time machine crunched and shattered. %%Streaks of blue seared my vision as I watched the culmination of twenty years of work %%splinter and fly apart through the lab.

I tried to make my way through the laboratory... %%As it was coming apart, one of the box's parts flew past me into another room. %%Gotta make sure it didn't take out a support or anything...

A tool in my hand - the trusty Henry actuator. %%It was built to remotely activate circuits out %%of your reach.%% %%Apparently it's also good for bridging broken %%door connections.

It seems the fabric of time was %%broken. %% %%At any given moment, the present %%comes from the past and goes to %%the future. %% %%Well, that's how it should work.

That familiar function was gone.%% %%Instead, the present goes to %%the past, the past goes to the %%future, I don't even know.%% %% %%As I stood around, I found %%myself suddenly walking out of %%the time machine again.

The ghostly figure of my first %%experience walked out as well.%% %%Walking through yourself is strange. %% %% %%Apparently, since the cataclysm, %%time is linked back to itself. %%Every minute you exist, you jump back %%a minute.

But when I touch the gear, now %%faintly glowing with the residue %%of the shattered universe...%% %%I don't jump. %%All of a sudden, it's fixed.

No, wait. It just took longer. %% %%But maybe by collecting the parts... %% %%I can fix this.

Ah, the flux capacitor. Figures %%that this would be heavily irradiated. %% %%No sign of my comrades, but this piece of %%tubing might serve well to ward off whatever's %%making those noises...

Ray sphere. I always liked this thing. %%Kinda pretty. Nice light for reading by. %%Of course, it also grew a weird fungus that we couldn't identify... %% %%Kind of a bitch to clean.

I can't figure out if I've got a headache from %%finding my way through this hellish maze, %%or as some side-effect of the time radiation.
